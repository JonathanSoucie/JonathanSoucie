# Hi, I'm Jonathan Soucie 👋

# About Me 

📚 Currently in my 3rd year of Computer Engineering at the University of Ottawa

🔭 I'm interested in all things tech, I love to build full products, from 3d printing the case to designing the PCB.

🛠️ I’m currently working on a custom desk shelf with an integrated MacroPad, light controller, screen, and Mag-safe charger.
